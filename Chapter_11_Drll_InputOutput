* Output your birth_year in decimal,hexadecimal, and octal form.
* Label each value with the name of the base used.
* Lable each column with a tab delimiter.
* Go back to 2 and cause your output to show the base for each output.
* Try reading as octal, hex, etc for the below code.
* Explain the results.
